# Front-end Exercise

## Implement a simple React “New York Times - Most Popular” website

Implement a website built on React that displays the information retrieved from the API in the best way possible in terms of performance, UX and UI.

## The following minimal sections should be present:

- Homepage: list the most popular articles (Most Viewed by Section & Time Period)
- Detail page: show the article
- Navigation: to go back from the details page to the homepage and vice versa

The Homepage should include a search form that allows a user to search for articles by a search term/text string, the homepage should automatically update the list given this search results without reloading the page.

There's no need to consider unit tests for this exercise, although some points on what should be considered and working:

- The application should start with a simple command
- There should be a README file containing instructions on how to compile/start the application
- The application should work fine on the latest version of Google Chrome
- The application should be responsive, it should work fine on either Desktop or Mobile
- The application should be bug free
